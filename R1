To implement a many-to-many relationship between Employee and a new Project entity in your Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

1. Define the Project Entity:

Create a Project class annotated with @Entity. This class should include an id field as the primary key and a name field for the project's name. Establish a bidirectional many-to-many relationship with the Employee entity using the @ManyToMany annotation. A join table named employee_project will manage the associations between employees and projects.

@Entity
@Table(name = "project")
public class Project {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = "project_name")
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(
        name = "employee_project",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "project_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id")
    )
    private Set<Employee> employees = new HashSet<>();

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}


2. Update the Employee Entity:

Modify the existing Employee class to include a many-to-many relationship with the Project entity. Use the mappedBy attribute to indicate that the projects field is the inverse side of the relationship, referencing the employees field in the Project class.

@Entity
@Table(name = "employee")
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "email")
    private String email;

    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name = "employee_skills", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id"))
    @Column(name = "skill")
    private Set<String> skills = new HashSet<>();

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<EmploymentHistory> employmentHistories;

    @Embedded
    private Address address;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "employees")
    private Set<Project> projects = new HashSet<>();

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}


3. Create the ProjectRepository Interface:

Define a repository interface for the Project entity by extending JpaRepository. This will provide CRUD operations for managing projects.

@Repository
public interface ProjectRepository extends JpaRepository<Project, Integer> {
}


4. Develop the ProjectService Class:

Implement a service class to handle business logic related to projects. Use the @Service annotation and inject the ProjectRepository to perform operations.

@Service
public class ProjectService {

    @Autowired
    private ProjectRepository projectRepository;

    public Project saveProject(Project project) {
        return projectRepository.save(project);
    }

    public List<Project> getAllProjects() {
        return projectRepository.findAll();
    }

    // Additional methods as needed
}


5. Implement the ProjectController Class:

Create a REST controller to manage HTTP requests related to projects. Use the @RestController annotation and map requests to /projects.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/projects")
public class ProjectController {

    @Autowired
    private ProjectService projectService;

    @PostMapping
    public Project createProject(@RequestBody Project project) {
        return projectService.saveProject(project);
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Project> getAllProjects() {
        return projectService.getAllProjects();
    }

    // Additional endpoints as needed
}


6. Update the EmployeeController Class:

Modify the EmployeeController to handle the assignment of projects to employees. When creating or updating an employee, ensure that the associated projects are correctly set.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/employee")
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeService employeeService;

    @Autowired
    private ProjectRepository projectRepository;

    @PostMapping
    public Employee createEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
        employee.getEmploymentHistories().forEach(emp -> emp.setEmployee(employee));
        employee.getProjects().forEach(project -> {
            Project existingProject = projectRepository.findById(project.getId())
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Project not found"));
            existingProject.getEmployees().add(employee);
        });
        return employeeService.saveEmployee(employee);
    }

    // Additional endpoints as needed
}


7. Database Schema:

Ensure that your database schema includes the project and employee_project tables to support the many-to-many relationship. The employee_project table serves as the join table linking employees and projects.

CREATE TABLE project (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    project_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employee_project (
    employee_id INT,
    project_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employee(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES project(id)
);



By following these steps, you establish a many-to-many relationship between Employee and Project entities. This setup allows each employee to be associated with multiple projects and vice versa. The employee_project join table maintains these associations, enabling efficient management and retrieval of data.
